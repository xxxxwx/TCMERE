The code has been tested with Python 3. To install the dependencies, please run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
After downloading the datasets, please create a new folder resources and put the datasets into that folder. Overall, the folder structure of the entire repo should look like:

...
models/
resources/
--- biorelex/
------- train.json
------- dev.json
scorer/
.gitignore

...
./TCMroberta In this folder are the secondary pre-training language models in the field of TCM

For training, please refer to the scripts trainer.py. For example, to train a basic model for TCMERE, you can simply run:

python trainer.py
There are some redundant code in this repo.Some of the code retains the source code names. I am going to remove them soon.
